                    Being a freshman in University of Saint Louis gave me an exhilarating experience. I was well adjusted in college life. There have been a lot
                    of pressures and struggles, such as not enough time to finish numerous assessments. There's those unapproachable professors, but in the end
                    I was able to get high grades. The more I struggled the more I wanted to learn more. The SLP activity, if not the best, was one of the best
                    college days. We were able to share our knowledge and experiences to our younger aspiring ITs and CSs. I have had sleepless nights, but those
                    eyebags are worth the ugliness. And those PE videos makes me cringe, yet it was fun to do. In the end of the year, I was able to make it both
                    semesters in the President's Lists scholarship discount!

                    The life of my being a sophomore year is still under construction. Nevertheless, it's a swift and sweet ride. My professors are very kind and
                    approachable which makes learning wonderful. Alas, there's a wheat in the corn field of professors! But, as far as learning goes, it's been going
                    great. The assessments are getting harder, but that doesn't make being a computer science student hard. It just makes learning interesting. As the
                    2nd semester started, I already felt its brutality! And also the SLP is right around the bush, we're gonna be busy. My favorite activity so far
                    is when I bought health kits for the charity program of the university. Despite all of that, I'm still hanging on. I can make it. I can do it!

                    Hey, I am an aspiring software developer, at your service! My hobbies are reading and watching. I also love to swim.
                    I chose Computer Science because its a high salary career (hey, I'm just being practical!),
                    and my love for computers and the internet world and programming. As the new trend in career would be programming, I chose
                    to study computer science. Computer science never fails to amaze me in the programming world.
                    I can see myself in 5 years having a software developer job. Maybe, if I'm in luck, in abroad!
